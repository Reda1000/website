# My Personal (static) Website
I also used to have a more elaborate personal website / presentation at [my homepage](http://david-renner.de) - bear with me when there is another content due to special events such as COVID (COVID caused me to establish a Jitsi-Instance on my server for demo reasons for business and private projects).
